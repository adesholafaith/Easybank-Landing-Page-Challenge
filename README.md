# Easybank-Landing-Page-Challenge
A fictional landing page for a digital bank

# Overview
This project is a Bank Landing Page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was designed with a desktop-first approach to give a professional, modern, and trustworthy look that a bank website requires. The page highlights the bank’s core services, features, and customer benefits, while maintaining simplicity and responsiveness.

# Built with
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, custom properties)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity
- Desktop-first workflow
- Responsive design principles

# What I learned
Through this project, I learned to:
- Apply desktop-first design principles, then scale down for smaller screens.
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox together for advanced layout control.
- Add JavaScript functionality for improved user experience.
- Write reusable and maintainable CSS with variables and modular class naming.
- Think more about user flow and brand consistency when designing landing pages.

# Continued development
For future improvements, I’d like to:
- Add form validation and interactive banking features with JavaScript.
- Introduce CSS animations and transitions for smoother UI effects.
- Create a dark mode toggle for better accessibility.
